# Project Pandora's Botanical Box

## Summary
The goal of this project is to create an enclosed ecosystem that will be used to grow plants and fish. The plants will grow using hydroponics. A container at the base of the box will hold fish and water. The water will be pumped to the top of the box and the water will trickle down to water plants several times a day
