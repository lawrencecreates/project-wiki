## vision


To provide a visual companion to the music that mirrors, roughly, lyrical subject matter.  One of the tenets of the Lawrence Creates Mission Statement is the support of artists in pursuit of their art.  I have always felt like I would make a great director of film, specifically accompanied by music, but I have little resources and support.  I feel LCM has the capability to fulfill those needs.
