# Project Living Vertical Garden

## Summary

The Lawrence Art Guild will work on a collaborative outreach project to be constructed during the annual Roger Hill Volunteer Center "Summer of Service" volunteer youth program. 

A "living mural" to be used by the East Lawrence Community, with minimal maintenance, and a variety of color (there are so many hues of green), that will not only contribute to the aesthetic value of the Lawrence Creates Makerspace, but create opportunities for training 
Local community members on DIY & budget gardening, composting, container plantings and more!

I'm not sure if we will lump in Anthony's "pandora's garden" hydroponic, temperature, air and water controlled indoor greenhouse under this project title?  But I don't see why we wouldn't include this in our search for Grant funding...

## Timeline
First, I would like to compile a list of grants available for community gardening, public art and creative placemaking. And begin asking local greenhouses for in-kind donations of seeds, soil, plants, and other necessary plotting materials.

Funding deadlines start in early December and vary through May 2014.

We can begin building the structure for the garden as soon as we research a design, and materials & labor costs.  Then there is picking out the types of plants we will use....

Actual planting could not start until March. (Alternatively this could be a good Earth Day project)
## resources
Amanda has led two summer of service mural projects for the Roger hill Volunteer Center.

Suzanne is already working to teach container gardening & composting to local single-mothers, as a way of promoting sustainability and good nutrition.

Ann has successfully written grants for other non-profit organizations in the community.
## vision

Lawrence Creates is a space for ALL people, regardless of experiences or education, to come together and work to benefit the entire Lawrence community.  This project can reach a vast socio-economic segment of the city and is an opportunity for Lawrence Creates Makerspace to make available & provide low-cost training open to the public..
