# Project Lawrence Creates Gallery

## Summary
The Lawrence Creates Gallery will host the Opening Reception for its inaugural exhibition, "Friends Remember Jim: A Retrospective of the collections and collaborative artwork owned and created by the friends of Lawrence Artist, Jim Brothers.

We plan to use this reception, and other Lawrence Creates Makerspace events p (I.e. new Year's) as a VIP event(s) for sponsors.

Future exhibitions include a Upcycled: 90% Recycled Art Assemblage Juried Exhibit, in conjunction with Earth Day (Hint: Grow Team) and an interactive installation of Art + Technology, to coincide with the Lawrence Art Center's FreeState Film Festival.

## vision
This exhibition will be the first impression the Lawrence Creates Gallery will makes the Cultural Arts District and will establish its reputation as an interactive, "learning gallery" in the local Arts community, and potentially gain us National attention a a Hackerspace. It will be the first Lawrence Art Guild sponsored exhibit since closing the 1109 Gallery in June. This exhibition is cohesive with the Art Guild's archiving project, The Chronicle. 

We hope to establish sponsorship for operating costs, staffing, and future exhibitions, whilst creating a donor & mailing list to be used to solicit future funding for both the Lawrence Art Guild & Lawrence Creates.
